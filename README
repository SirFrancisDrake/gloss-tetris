gloss-tetris
============

The title is self-explanatory.

TODO:
* Implement scoring
* Implement the classic rotation strategy (allow everything)
* Add the settings screen
* Fix gloss to allow error-free application exiting and window resizing
  * Or move on to another rendering library
* Add more color schemas
  * And improve the current one
